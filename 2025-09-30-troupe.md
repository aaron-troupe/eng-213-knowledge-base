# Scientific Oversimplification

This week's reading was talking about scientific oversimplifications. The reading is talking about how oversimplifying scientific things may look harmless but is actually very harmful for the future. The video describes the “long tail” which means that when people are talking about scientific concepts to someone who doesn’t understand them as well, that definition of those concepts will stick with them, regardless if they are correct or not.

An example I thought of a lot while reading the article was a youtube channel I watched called “Nile Red” which talks about chemistry. He does fun videos showing chemical processes and they are never lying or saying anything incorrect, but these videos oversimplify these very complicated chemistry concepts. And as most people watching these videos are not professional chemists, these concepts stick with them making it seem way easier. This is unintentionally spreading a lot of misinformation which could significantly change people's lives. For example if I saw these videos I may be curious about chemistry and want to take it up as a career even if it is nothing like I assumed it was.

This has led many people to question how we create scientific media and if we need to tweak it in order to spread correct information about science.

“I like to think of this as being how fast information and data can be transferred digitally, while also thinking about what is going into the writing of that transferred data”

This ties to scientific oversimplification as media is transferred so fast that you need to be composing your work in order to keep it accurate.

“A device is not always easy to use, especially at one's first attempt. This is something more commonly seen within older generations who didn't grow up with the product”

This was in reference to talking about digital literacy but is also a good example for this as things do not usually click the first time around, which is why oversimplifying is dangerous.

“Youtube video is far less intimidating than attempting to read an entire textbook”

This was also about scientific oversimplification and is a good point to see. Youtube videos make things easy and entertaining but leads to misinformation.
