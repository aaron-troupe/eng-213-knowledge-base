# Understanding Rhetorical Velocity

Rhetorical velocity is defined as “a conscious rhetorical concern for distance, travel, speed, and time, pertaining specifically to theorizing instances of strategic appropriation by a third party.” This concept refers to the speed at which major events are disseminated—whether news, creative works, or viral content. Essentially, rhetorical velocity describes how quickly you learn about something new that has just happened.

# Connections to Manovich’s Ideas on New Media

This concept ties in closely with Manovich's theories on new media and how digital technologies accelerate communication processes. Decades ago, people relied on newspapers for major updates, which significantly slowed down the spread of information. Even longer ago, information traveled by messenger or ship, sometimes taking months.

In contrast, news now spreads within minutes. For example, when Donald Trump was shot at a rally, I heard about it almost instantly and received constant updates regarding his condition and details about the suspect.

# Rhetorical Velocity and Remix Culture

Rhetorical velocity also helps us understand composing for recomposition and remixing. Today’s media consumers quickly remix news in the form of memes, commentary, or reinterpretations. In the Trump example, people created jokes, political takes, and satirical posts almost immediately.

Alexander and Rhodes emphasize how new media differs drastically from older forms. Writing is constantly evolving—people remix major events so heavily that the interpretation of the event itself can change. While older media also saw remixing, it was slower and more limited, often taking the form of political cartoons or editorial illustrations.

# Conclusion

Overall, rhetorical velocity highlights how rapidly news travels and how that speed influences remix culture. Combined with Manovich and Alexander & Rhodes, it demonstrates how new media transforms not just how we receive information, but how we reshape it.
