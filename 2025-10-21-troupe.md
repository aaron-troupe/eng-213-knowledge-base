# Introduction

AI has exploded in popularity over recent years. However, as its use has grown, many people have begun to identify ethical concerns and express hesitation toward this rapidly developing technology.

# Built-In Biases and Discrimination

In the *Rolling Stone* article **“These Women Tried to Warn Us About AI,”** we see how AI systems can become dangerous in several ways. One major issue is built-in discrimination. Because AI absorbs and analyzes massive amounts of online content, it also learns biases present in that data. Some of this may also stem from the creators themselves, who may unconsciously design systems favoring white men.

# Lack of Control and Oversimplification

Another major concern is the lack of control AI developers have over their own systems. Despite recognizing biases in their models, creators often have limited control in preventing these flaws. Companies rarely reveal these issues to users, even when they are aware of them.

This connects to ideas discussed in **From *Hype to Practice* (Jiang et al., 2024)**—specifically the concept of oversimplification. Technologies like AI appear powerful, helpful, and exciting, which makes them easy to oversimplify. Companies portray AI as an all-knowing tool with no drawbacks, causing users to overlook critical issues such as discrimination, factual mistakes, and massive environmental impacts.

# AI in Education

AI is also increasingly used in schools. In **“We Lied to You… and We’ll Do It Again”** by Young, Driessen, and Pridmore (2024), students admitted to using AI tools. While some educators express concern about AI’s role in academic integrity, many students value AI as a brainstorming tool.

Interestingly, although students liked using AI for idea generation, many disliked having it write full papers. They reported that AI-written work did not match their voice and made their writing feel less authentic.

# Conclusion

Overall, while AI offers powerful tools and exciting possibilities, it also raises serious ethical concerns. Understanding biases, avoiding oversimplification, and critically examining how AI is used—especially in education—are essential for creating a responsible and informed relationship with these technologies.
